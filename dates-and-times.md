*This is a followup to [lesson 10](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course.*

You probably know about numbers, but probably not one of the biggest contexts in which numbers are useful: keeping track of time. Let's change that now!

***Note:** All numbers on this page are in seximal (base 6) unless otherwise specified.*

## Time
Time is extremely easy: just say "[hour] kynsi [minute]"! Here are some details:
- Days are defined the same way that they are in English: 40 hours in a day, with 140 minutes in an hour (remember that these numbers are in seximal!).
- If there are zero minutes, you can omit the minutes entirely (i.e. instead of saying "fo kynsi fui" for "2:00", you can say "fo kynsi").
- Fynotek uses a 24-hour clock, so instead of saying "1:00 PM", you would say "21:00", or "fopo ay kynsi". Midnight is 0:00 (fui kynsi).

To say the time, you can use "fuho", like this:
> *fuho us kynsi fo.*\
> It is 3:02.

### Abbreviation
Abbreviating time is done with "[hour]K[minute]" (or "[hour]k[minute]"). When abbreviating, keep the 0 if there are no minutes.

Examples:
> *fuho 21K0.*\
> It is 21:00 (13:00 or 1:00 PM in decimal).

> *fuho 3k2.*\
> It is 3:02.

## Dates
Fynotek defines two calendar systems: the Gregorian calendar (what most of us use) and the native Fynotek calendar.

### Native Calendar
Today, the vocab will be in the lesson, since we need it to talk about dates.
> jeaj: day\
> ñytuh: moon, month (native calendar)\
> tfaa: circle, circular, cycle, year (native calendar)

Note that the words for "moon" and "cycle" are also the words for "month" and "year" in this system. This is due to the fact that this calendar is entirely based on the moon, as we will see.

#### Definition of Time Units
Each year (*tfaa*) has five months (*ñytuh*), with each month alternating between having 29 or 30 days. Here is the number of days in the first few months:
> month 1: 29 days\
> month 2: 30 days\
> month 3: 29 days\
> month 4: 30 days\
> month 5: 29 days\
> month 6: 30 days\
> etc.

Note that since each year has 5 months, month 6 is the first month of the second year.

Fynotek's calendar aligns to the cycles of the moon, and to keep it in sync, every fourth year is a leap year, with its second month getting an extra day:
> year 4 month 1: 30 days\
> year 4 month 2: **30 days**\
> year 4 month 3: 30 days\
> year 4 month 4: 29 days\
> year 4 month 5: 30 days
<br>
Each month has four weeks (note that even though Fynotek has the concept of a week, it has no word for it).

If a month has 29 days, the weeks go as follows:
> week 1: 7 days\
> week 2: 7 days\
> week 3: 7 days\
> week 4: 8 days

If a month has 30 days, they go like this:
> week 1: 7 days\
> week 2: 7 days\
> week 3: 7 days\
> week 4: 8 days
