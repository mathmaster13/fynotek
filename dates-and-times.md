*This is a followup to [lesson 10](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course.*

You probably know about numbers, but probably not one of the biggest contexts in which numbers are useful: keeping track of time. Let's change that now!

***Note:** All numbers on this page are in seximal (base 6) if in Fynotek, and decimal (nase 10) if in English.*

## Time
Time is extremely easy: just say "[hour] kynsi [minute]"! Here are some details:
- Days are defined the same way that they are in English: 40 hours in a day, with 140 minutes in an hour (remember that these numbers are in seximal!).
- If there are zero minutes, you can omit the minutes entirely (i.e. instead of saying "fo kynsi fui" for "2:00", you can say "fo kynsi").
- Fynotek uses a 24-hour clock, so instead of saying "1:00 PM", you would say "21:00", or "fopo ay kynsi". Midnight is 0:00 (fui kynsi).

To say the time, you can use "fuho", like this:
> *fuho us kynsi fo.*\
> It is 3:02.

### Abbreviation
Abbreviating time is done with "[hour]K[minute]" (or "[hour]k[minute]"). When abbreviating, keep the 0 if there are no minutes.

Examples:
> *fuho 21K0.*\
> It is 13:00 (or 1:00 PM).

> *fuho 3k2.*\
> It is 3:02.

## Dates
Fynotek defines two calendar systems: the Gregorian calendar (what most of us use) and the native Fynotek calendar.

### Native Calendar
Today, the vocab will be in the lesson, since we need it to talk about dates.
> jeaj: day\
> ñytuh: moon, month (native calendar)\
> tfaa: circle, circular, cycle, year (native calendar), of or relating to the Fynotek native calendar

Note that the words for "moon" and "cycle" are also the words for "month" and "year" in this system. This is due to the fact that this calendar is entirely based on the moon, as we will see.

Also note that the word for year, *tfaa*, can also be used as a modifier to describe the calendar system itself.

#### Definition of Time Units
There are two erasm *kynsi fynotekñy* (time of no Fynotek) and *kynsifynotek* (time of Fynotek). The first day of *kynsifynotek* is Fynotek's creation date, which is January 5, 2021. Any day before that is in *kynsi fynotekñy*. Just like BCE dates in the Gregorian calendar, years count backwards in *kynsi fynotekñy*, so the year before January 5 2021 is year 1 in *kynsi fynotekñy*.

Each year (*tfaa*) has five months (*ñytuh*), with each month alternating between having 29 or 30 days. Here is the number of days in the first few months:
> month 1: 29 days\
> month 2: 30 days\
> month 3: 29 days\
> month 4: 30 days\
> month 5: 29 days\
> month 6: 30 days\
> etc.

Note that since each year has 5 months, month 6 is the first month of the second year.

Fynotek's calendar aligns to the cycles of the moon, and to keep it in sync, every fourth year is a leap year, with its second month getting an extra day:
> year 4 month 1: 30 days\
> year 4 month 2: **30 days**\
> year 4 month 3: 30 days\
> year 4 month 4: 29 days\
> year 4 month 5: 30 days
<br>
Each month has four weeks (note that even though Fynotek has the concept of a week, it has no word for it).

If a month has 29 days, the weeks go as follows:
> week 1: 7 days\
> week 2: 7 days\
> week 3: 7 days\
> week 4: 8 days

If a month has 30 days, they go like this:
> week 1: 7 days\
> week 2: 7 days\
> week 3: 7 days\
> week 4: 8 days

#### Writing Dates
A full date in Fynotek consists of five parts, in this order:
- the day of the month
- the day of the week
- the month of the year
- the year of the era
- the era

Any of these can be dropped to express less specific dates (e.g. expressing only a month instead of a specific day in that month), or if context allows for the date to still be identifiable. When being formal, though, you need all of these (except the era, which is optional).

Here is how you express each part of the date:
- To express the day of the month, use an ordinal number as described in [lesson 10](INSERT LINK) (e.g. the 24th day of the month is "nosporea").
- To express the day of the week, attach the word *jeaj* as a suffix to the number of the day (e.g. the 7th day of the week is "aypo ayjeaj").
- To express the month of the year, attach the word *ñytuh* to the number of the month (e.g. the 3rd month of the year is "usñytuh").
- To express the year of the era, attach the word *tfaa* to the number of the year (e.g. the 2nd year is "fotfaa").
- To express the era, use the words *kynsi fynotekñy* or *kynsifynotek*, as described earlier.

For example, January 1 2022 is the 8th day of the 3rd month (and the 1st day of its week) of the 3rd year in *kynsifynotek*, so it is written as *aypo forea ayjeaj usñytuh ustfaa kynsifynotek*.

If necessary, you can use *tfaa* as a detached modifier after a partial date to indicate that you're using the Fynotek calendar system and not the Gregorian system. However, ***only do this when necessary***—if your date contains a month, year, or era, the words in your date already specify the calendar system. It can also be clear from context that you are using the Fynotek system, and in that case, do not do this.

*For a set of dates in the Fynotek calendar along with their corresponding Gregorian dates, see [this table](INSERT LINK).*

### Gregorian Calendar
When we interact with the rest of the world, we can use the Gregorian calendar: 12 months in a year, 7 days in a week, you know the drill. Here is the vocabulary used to express Gregorian dates:
> jeaj: day\
> ñytejen: month (Gregorian calendar)\
> ejen: sun, sunny, year (Gregorian calendar), of or relating to the Gregorian calendar

Similar to how the word *tfaa* means "cycle" and refers to a year in the Fynotek calendar, *ejen* means "sun" and refers to a year in the Gregorian calendar (which is based on the sun). And, like *tfaa*, *ejen* can be used to talk about things related to the Gregorian calendar. This is why the word for a Gregorian month is a combination of the word for a Fynotek month (*ñytuh*) and *ejen*.

#### Writing Dates
Dates are expressed similarly to how the Fynotek calendar expresses them, except for these things:
- Use *ñytejen* instead of *ñytuh* for months.
- Use *ejen* instead of *tfaa* for years.
- Use *kynsimjuw* (old time) for BC/BCE, and *kynsijuon* (new time) for AD/CE.

Some other things to keep in mind:
- In Fynotek, Monday is the first day of a Gregorian week, and Sunday is the seventh.
- Like in the native system, any part of a date can be dropped if context is sufficient to specify the date, and when used formally, everything except the era is required.

As an example, March 15 2020 is written in full as *fopo usrea aypo ayjeaj usñytejen aypoña uspopura fopura nosejen kynsijuon*.

### Abbreviation
In either calendar system, abbreviations are made by writing the day-of-month, day-of-week, month, and year as numbers (in seximal, of course), in that order, and separated by dots. ***None of these can be omitted!*** For example, the abbreviation for March 15 2020 is *23.7.3.13203*.

Optionally, you can abbreviate the era as well. In the Fynotek calendar, *kynsi fynotekñy* is *KÑ*, and *kynsifynotek* is *KF*. In the Gregorian calendar, *kynsimjuw* is *KM*, and *kynsijoun* is *KJ* (capitalization is optional, as always). These abbreviations go after the date, and can be used even if you wrote the rest of the date out in full. For example, the date *aypo forea ayjeaj usñytuh ustfaa kynsifynotek* can be abbreviated as *12.1.3.3 KF*.

If you do not specify the era in a date abbreviation (which specifies the calendar system already), you can optionally specify what calendar system you are using by placing the word *tfaa* after a Fynotek date, or the word *ejen* after a Gregorian date. However, when reading these dates, do not pronounce the *tfaa* or *ejen* after the date, since the other words spoken in the date will already determine what calendar system is being used!

For example, "33.2.2.5 tfaa" is read as "uspo usrea fojeaj foñytuh purtfaa", with the extra "tfaa" in the abbreviation not being pronounced.

Only use *ejen* and *tfaa* in an abbreviation if you're not already specifying the calendar system with the era! And remember that things can often be made clear with context—you rarely will need to talk about the year 13203 in the Fynotek calendar, for example.
