*This is a followup to [lesson 10](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course.*

You probably know about numbers, but probably not one of the biggest contexts in which numbers are useful: keeping track of time. Let's change that now!

***Note:** All numbers on this page are in seximal (base 6) unless otherwise specified.*

### Time
Time is extremely easy: just say "[hour] kynsi [minute]"! Here are some details:
- Days are defined the same way that they are in English: 40 hours in a day, with 140 minutes in an hour (remember that these numbers are in seximal!).
- If there are zero minutes, you can omit the minutes entirely (i.e. instead of saying "fo kynsi fui" for "2:00", you can say "fo kynsi").
- Fynotek uses a 24-hour clock, so instead of saying "1:00 PM", you would say "21:00", or "fopo ay kynsi". Midnight is 0:00 (fui kynsi).

To say the time, you can use "fuho", like this:
> *fuho us kynsi fo.*\
> It is 3:02.

#### Abbreviation
Abbreviating time is done with "[hour]K[minute]" (or "[hour]k[minute]"). When abbreviating, keep the 0 if there are no minutes.

Examples:
> *fuho 21K0.*\
> It is 21:00 (13:00 or 1:00 PM in decimal).
>
> *fuho 3k2.*\
> It is 3:02.

### Dates
