*This is a followup to [Lesson 8](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course.*

*ak/ka* and *ki/ik* aren't done yet. It's time we learn about the grand switcheroo.

### The Grand Switcheroo
Recall that you can place context at the beginning of a sentence between *ak* and *ka*.
> Example: *ak jeajjuon ka ywasefo* - "Today I am happy."

If you want to place context at the end of a sentence, switch *ak* and *ka* around!
> Example: *ywasefo ka jeajjuon ak* - "I am happy today."

The formula for context at the end of a sentence is "\<sentence> ka \<context> ak". Pretty simple!

### Chaining with *ak/ka*
You can chain *ak/ka* clauses. When you do so, each *ak* after the first is skipped.
> Example: *ak ilynak ka ratasñy ka mikipñy yramo.*

Each clause applies only to the next clause, not the whole sentence, so "ilynak" is given as context to "ratasñy", and then "ratasñy" is given as context to the rest of the sentence.
This means that this sentence can be rewritten as *ak ilynak ka ratasñy. ak ratasñy ka mikipñy yramo.* From here, we can translate this as "In the context of computers, I don't know. In the context of 'I don't know', I don't use them.", or "I don't understand computers, so I don't use them".

Of course, *ka/ak* clauses can also be chained. Here, *ka* is skipped after the first one, and each clause applies only to the one *before* it.
> Example: *mikipñy yramo ka ratasñy ak ilynak ak.*

This is the same sentence as the previous example, but with the words in a different order.


### What about *ik* and *ki*?
Just like with *ak* and *ka*, you can switch the order of *ik* and *ki* to change what the phrase inside is applied to:
> Example:
> *fmutue ki hiro ñaka ik ampuo.
> ik hiro ñaka ki fmutue ampuo.*

Both of these mean "The person who spoke to you is leaving". The only difference is that when you use *ki/ik*, the phrase inside is applied to what is before it, and when you use *ik/ki*, the phrase inside is applied to what is after it.

If you want a formula for *ik/ki*, it's "ik \<verb phrase> ki \<thing you want to modify>". Not too hard!

### Chaining with *ki/ik*
*ki/ik* chaining is similar to *ak/ka* chaining, but all clauses apply to the original noun instead of to each other. Skip every *ik* after the first if using *ik/ki*, and skip every *ki* after the first if using *ki/ik*.
> Example: *fmutue ki hiro ñaka ik ampio fotaenejiy ik fuhoñata.* - "The person who spoke to you and went to their house is named Ñata."

Notice that both "spoke to you" (*hiro ñaka*) and "went to their house" (*ampio fataenejiy*) are applied to *fmutue*.

Finally! Your knowledge of particles is complete, for real this time!
