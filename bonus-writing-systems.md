*This is a followup to [Lesson 11](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course. It is recommended that you have completed the whole course before reading this.*

There are more writing systems for Fynotek than just *ojnym*. Let's talk about them!

### *ojnyla*
TODO: *ojnyla* and *ojnym* are changing, since *ojnyla*'s purpose has had a decently large shift. Update this document as changes happen.

This name is a combination of the words *ojnym* and *yla*, and as thaat suggests, *ojnyla* is a simplified version of *ojnym*, intended to be used in more immature contexts (such as with small children).
  
It removes the horizontal line and diacritic forms of glyphs, so spaces between words are required. However, it still has most features of *ojnym*, such as separate glyphs for vowels affected by conjugation and part-of-speech prefixes, and tone-marking punctuation. It is written left-to-right.

### the unnamed abugida
This is a system made by Fynotek's creator, but isn't publically documented outside of here. It has not been given a name.

Consonants are marked with symbols, and vowels are marked with a diacritic on the consonant before it. While diphthongs are written as normal (the first vowel is applied to the consonant before it, and the second vowel is applied to a no-consonant marker), long vowels have special diacritics. Like *ojnym*, this system has a line running through each word, and tone-marking punctuation, but it does now have any special symbols for grammatical features. It is written from top to bottom, with pages going from left to right.

Now you can write your Fynotek in style :)
