title: Modifying Particles
---

*This is a followup to [lesson 9](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course.*

I know I've said that we were done with particles three times now. I know that I have lied all three times. But I promise that today will be the last particle-related lesson we have. It's about *sta*, *ni*, and how to modify them.

## Modifying Particles?
It may seem weird to modify a particle—after all, they don't have any content meaning—but you've already seen a modifier on a particle! If you remember from lesson 9, *stañy* is how you say "no" to a question, and is a combination of *sta* and *ñy*. There are a few other words that can be used this way, as well!

### Modifying *sta*
Besides *ñy*, *sta* can also be modified by *yla* (small) and *ula* (big) to change the intensity of your answer. So, *staula* is similar to saying "absolutely!", and *stayla* is similar to saying "kind of" or "I guess" in response to a question.

You can, of course, negate these: *stañyula* can be translated as "absolutely not!" and *stañyyla* as "not really". These are, of course, not the only translations—what matters most when modifying *sta* is the intensity or enthusiasm of your response.

### Modifying *ni*
While *ni* cannot be modified by *ñy*, it can be modified by *ula* and *yla* to show the importance of the command being given—*niula* indicates that it is very important, and *niyla* that it is not very important.
> Example: *ampa niula!* - "Go!" (urgent)

That's it for modifying particles! We, for real this time, shouldn't be having any more particle lessons :)
