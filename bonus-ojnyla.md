*This is a followup to [Lesson 11](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course. It is recommended that you have completed the whole course before reading this.*

There is another writing system for Fynotek that wasn't shown in the lesson about *ojnym*. Let's talk about it!

## *ojnyla*

This name is a combination of the words *ojnym* and *yla*, and as thaat suggests, *ojnyla* is a simplified version of *ojnym*, intended to be used in more immature contexts (such as with small children).
  
It removes the horizontal line and diacritic forms of glyphs, so spaces between words are required. However, it still has most features of *ojnym*, such as separate glyphs for vowels affected by conjugation and part-of-speech prefixes, and tone-marking punctuation. It is written left-to-right.
  
[Insert a chart, and some examples]

Now you can write your Fynotek like a child :)
