*This is a followup to [Lesson 11](INSERT LINK) of the official Fynotek course. It is recommended that you have completed the whole course before reading this.*

There is another writing system for Fynotek that wasn't shown in the lesson about *ojnym*. Let's talk about it!

## *ojnyla*

This name is a combination of the words *ojnym* and *yla*, and as thaat suggests, *ojnyla* is a simplified version of *ojnym*, intended to be used in contexts involving small children. Once you're past about ten (Gregorian) years old, you'll probably solely be using *ojnym*. It may also be used in contexts where illiterate or disabled adults are first learning to write, but the goal is always to eventually write in *ojnym*.

*ojnyla* removes the horizontal line and diacritic forms of glyphs, so spaces between words are required. However, it still has most features of *ojnym*, such as separate glyphs for vowels affected by conjugation and part-of-speech prefixes, and tone-marking punctuation. It is written left-to-right.

And that's all there is to *ojnyla* :)
