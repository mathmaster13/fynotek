If you want to learn some of the more obscure and powerful bits of Fynotek, you're in the right place! If you haven't used the [official Fynotek course](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhD20vikLE6JgUWnj4EwJ9ycEKHQzH_Qi7ZsBBT4j6k/edit) (see the "lessons" section of the spreadsheet), you should do that first, as this picks up where it leaves off. The content in here is all officially part of Fynotek, but not all of it is in the current version of the documentation. Hopefully it will be updated soon :)

## So you made it through the course?
sefo! ak hiksjuon ka fynoteko ew inklyso (English) hur, oni ak hepwaka i mikapa hoksjuon ka fynoteko ni rataesa. You should know enough Fynotek to form sentences with the grammar and vocab from the official course, but you don't need to be perfect! Feel free to look back if you need toâ€”I'll provide links to relevant information in all of these.

Note that this course's convention is to never use capital letters in Fynotek. You can if you want, but the lessons will not.

Alright! Let's start :)
