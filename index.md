## Welcome!
If you came here, you're probably either looking for one of my projects for Fynotek, or for info about Fynotek in general. For general things, please see Fynotek's [official website](https://aspenlangs.neocities.org/fyn.html). For my projects, see below:


### [fynotek-java](https://github.com/mathmaster13/fynotek-java) (Java library)
- [Download](https://github.com/mathmaster13/fynotek-java/releases/latest)
- [Javadoc](https://mathmaster13.github.io/fynotek-java/javadoc/overview-tree.html)
- [Simple Conjugator](https://mathmaster13.github.io/fynotek-java/conjugator)

### [Advanced Fynotek Course](advanced-course)
This course is meant to cover any gaps that the [official Fynotek course](https://aspenlangs.neocities.org/fynles.html), which was made by mochaspen and myself, did not cover. It is a work-in-progress.
