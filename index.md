If you haven't used the [official Fynotek course](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xhD20vikLE6JgUWnj4EwJ9ycEKHQzH_Qi7ZsBBT4j6k/edit) (see the "lessons" section of the spreadsheet), you should do that first, as this picks up where it leaves off.

## So you made it through the course?
sefo! ak hiksjuon ka fynoteko ew inklyso (English) hur, oni ak hepwaka i mikapa hoksjuon ka fynoteko ni rataesa. You should know enough Fynotek to form sentences with the grammar and vocab from the official course, but you don't need to be perfect! Feel free to look back if you need toâ€”I'll provide links to relevant information in all of these.

Oh, and if it wasn't obvious, I don't use capital letters ever in Fynotek. You can if you want, but this course will not.

Alright! Let's start :)
